<h3> 📜 About </h3>
I am a masters student of the Molecular and Cellular Biology Program at the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München😃

Currently, I am pursuing my master thesis titled 'Mapping the transcriptomic landscape of PBMCs across health and disease' under the guidance of Dr. Johanna Klughammer at the Gene Centre, LMU🧑‍💻

My project is divided into two parts and the first part revolves around creating a repository for healthy peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) scRNA-Seq data by trainining conditional neural networks through the scArches tool with datasets obtained from publications. This repository will allow the cell type repertoire and expression landscape mapping on to new, to-be-interpreted datasets and better understand the healthy and diseased states. 

The second part of my project involves building a sex classifier for scRNA-Seq data to classify cells into males and females. The classifier is in the final stages and can be found on [ScraMF](https://github.com/KlughammerLab/Sex-Classifier)
